## Welcome to the GitHub repository for my COVID-19 Website dedicated to Data in Malta 

This is currently a work in progress and if you have any interesting graphs / graphics to add please let me know. 
There are plenty of data and visualisations out there for COVID-19 but not many with the focus on Maltese data. 
Having these data all in one place will make for a more informed public.
