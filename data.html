    In this section of the website I provide graphs (provided by the department of public health dashboard) that summarise the local data. The first graph is a traditional scatter 
    plot of number of cases (y-axis) plotted against time (x-axis). There are five graphs on one plot. The red points represent
    the total (cumulative) number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Malta. The yellow points represent the total
    number of people who have recovered while the blue dots represent the total number of people who have, unfortunately, died of
    COVID-19. The purple points represent the "Active Cases" that is the total number of cases at the moment (which is the total
    number of cases minus the number of recoveries and deaths).
  </p>

    The next graph shows the age distribution of the data. The third graph classifies the types of cases into local or imported
    and the last graph indicates the number of new cases per day.

      To be able to properly interpret the age distribution graph above, it is useful to have the general population age 
      distribution (left side). The graph to the right gives an indication of how well Malta is doing in terms of what we would expect to see if the virus was
      spreading unchecked in an infinite population. The red line is the "expected growth" while the blue line is the "actual
      growth." This is a bit of a tricky graph but luckily, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg">minute physics
      </a> has provided a great video with an in-depth explanation of its interpretation. The video can be found on the
