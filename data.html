    In this section of the website I provide two graphs that summarise the local data. The first graph is a traditional scatter 
    plot of number of cases (y-axis) plotted against time (x-axis). There are four graphs on one plot. The blue points represent
    the total (cumulative) number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Malta. The yellow points represent the total
    number of people who have recovered while the red dots represent the total number of people who have, unfortunatly, died of
    COVID-19. The green points represent the "Active Cases" that is the total number of cases at the moment (which is the total
    number of cases minus the number of recoveries and deaths).

    The second graph gives an indication of how well Malta is doing in terms of what we would expect to see if the virus was
    spreading unchecked in an infinite population. The red line is the "expected growth" while the blue line is the "actual
    growth." This is a bit of a tricky graph but luckily, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg">minute physics
    </a> have provided a great video with an in-depth explanation of its interpretation. The video can be found on the 
    <a href="https://covid-malta.github.io/education">educational</a> of this site.
