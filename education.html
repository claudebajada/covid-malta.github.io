      <p> In this section I will introduce several educational videos that will help in understanding:
        
          <ol>
              <li> What is a Virus?</li>
              <li> What the novel Coronalvirus, or the SARS-Cov-2, is and the difference between that and COVID-19?</li>
              <li> What is a pandemic or epidemic?</li>
              <li> How can we understand, or predict things?</li>

        <h2> Viruses </h2>
        Viruses are strange biological things. They are tiny particles that are on the boarder of being alive. They are weird.
        The video below is from the fantastic free eductaional resource <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and will give you all the details you
        need to start off understanding what viruses actually are!<br />

        <h2> SARS-Cov-2</h2>
        The first thing to get out of the way is the name! Coronavirus, novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, what are all these names? 
        Are they the same thing? What are the differences. All the terms are slightly differnt. Coronavirus is a general name
        for a family (or group) of viruses. There are many coronaviruses around one of the new (novel) coronavirus that the 
        The <a href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> (basically the group of people that officially names viruses) called SARS-Cov-2.
        See <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z">Nature paper</a>.
        
        The video below is from the YouTube channel Strong Medicine, it provides an in-depth explanation about how viruses get their names. It was filmed
        Just before the new coronavirus was given its name.<br />
