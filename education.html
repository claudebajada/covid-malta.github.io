      <p> In this section I will introduce several, freely available, educational videos that will help in understanding:
        
          <ol>
              <li> What is a Virus?</li>
              <li> What is the novel Coronavirus, or the SARS-Cov-2? Is it different from COVID-19?</li>
              <li> What is a pandemic or epidemic?</li>
              <li> How can we understand, or predict things?</li>
              <li> What can I do to help?</li>
              <li> How can we know that our measures are working?</li>
              
          </ol>
      </p>

        <h2> Viruses </h2>
        Viruses are strange biological things. They are tiny particles that are on the border of being alive. They are weird.
        The video below is from the fantastic free educational resource <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> 
        and will give you all the details you need to start off understanding what viruses actually are!<br />

        <h2> SARS-Cov-2</h2>
        The first thing to get out of the way is the name! Coronavirus, novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, what are all these names? 
        Are they the same thing? What are the differences? All the terms are slightly different. Coronavirus is a general name
        for a family (or group) of viruses. There are many coronaviruses around, some are responsible for the common cold, another
        one was responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2019 a new (novel) coronavirus appeared. This new virus is the one that everyone is worried about.
        The <a href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> ( the group of people 
        that officially names viruses) called SARS-Cov-2.
        See their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z">Nature paper</a> for more information.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The video below is from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFq5vPnNRNNNysLrktz4aSw">Strong Medicine</a>. 
        It provides an in-depth explanation about how viruses get their names. It was filmed just before the new coronavirus was given its 
        name and so it still refers to it as "the novel coronavirus".<br />

         <h2>Epidemic vs Pandemic</h2>
         We are now constantly hearing a lot about epidemics and pandemics and all these new words can be confusing! Luckily, 
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nKWrOxInft2dNfgSFFvsA">Grammer Girl</a> is here to the rescue by 
         explaining what the difference is. In short, epidemic refer to an increase in the amount of a disease in one country
         while a pandemic is an epidemic that affects many countries at the same time.

          <h2>Understanding the Data</h2>
          After watching all of the above videos, we now have a fairly clear understanding of what viruses are in general, 
          what the SARS-Cov=2 virus is and what pandemics are. Great! But we are constantly hit with plenty of data from all
          over the world. From the daily press briefings of the local Public Health Department to worldwide data from websites
          such as the <a href url="https://covid-malta.github.io/data#JHU_map">Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus map</a>. But how can we make sense of it all? How can we use these data
          to make predictions about what will happen next?

      <p>
          Grant Sanderson from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> explains how
          what goes into epidemic modelling and also highlights why COVID-19 cases are growing so fast!
      </p>

      <p>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile">Numberphile</a> gives a more "mathy" and mechanistic explanation 
          of how to model epidemics. Watching this video should give you a better understanding of what it actually means 
          to "flatten the curve."

      </p>
      
      <p>
      <h2>How can I help?</h2>

          After watching the modelling videos above, it is clear that the most important thing to do is to stay home! It is
          understandable that people may have to leave the house for essential activities, but when you do, make sure to 
          minimise contact with other people. This is called "social distancing." And we saw that these measures really,
          really affect the spread of the virus!
      </p>

      <p>
        
          The other thing that you can do is wash your hands. Wash them well, and wash them often. The videos below explain
          why handwashing works and how to wash your hands properly!

          press briefings and legal notices. Also, visit the official <a href="https://covid19malta.info/">COVID-19 
          information page</a> by the Maltese Public health authorities where you can stay up to date with local guidelines.

      <h2>How do we know if our measures are working?</h2>

          With such a fast spreading virus, it is very difficult to judge how well countries are doing on a day-to-day basis.
          With exponential growth, a long incubation period of the virus mixed with the possibility of asymptomatic carriers 
          makes things even harder. However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg">minute physics
          </a> have provided a great video that explains how we can potentially monitor long term trends in the disease progression.

      <p> 
          You can see the local version of this graph in the <a href="https://covid-malta.github.io/data">data</a> section of 
          this website. It is always important not to let our guard down when it looks like we are doing well. It is very difficult
          to contain the virus but very easy to spread. A "bad week" can ruin all of the hard work that our professionals have put 
          into this.
