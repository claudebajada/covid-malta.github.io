      <p> In this section I will introduce several educational videos that will help in understanding:
        
          <ol>
              <li> What the novel Coronalvirus, or the SARS-Cov-2, is and the difference between that and COVID-19?</li>
              <li> What is a pandemic or epidemic?</li>
              <li> How can we understand, or predict things?</li>
              
          </ol>
      </p>

        <h2> SARS-COV-2</h2>
        The first thing to get out of the way is the name! Coronavirus, novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, what are all these names? 
        Are they the same thing? What are the differences. All the terms are slightly differnt. Coronavirus is a general name
        for a family (or group) of viruses. There are many coronaviruses around one of the new (novel) coronavirus that the 
        The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (basically the group who officially names viruses) called SARS-Cov-2.
