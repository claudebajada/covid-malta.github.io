      <p> In this section I will introduce several educational videos that will help in understanding:
        
          <ol>
              <li> What is a Virus?</li>
              <li> What the novel Coronalvirus, or the SARS-Cov-2, is and the difference between that and COVID-19?</li>
              <li> What is a pandemic or epidemic?</li>
              <li> How can we understand, or predict things?</li>
              
          </ol>

        <h2> Viruses </h2>
        Viruses are strange biological things. They are tiny particles that are on the boarder of being alive. They are weird.
        The video below is from the fantastic free eductaional resource <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and will give you all the details you
        need to start off understanding what viruses actually are!<br />

        <h2> SARS-Cov-2</h2>
        The first thing to get out of the way is the name! Coronavirus, novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, what are all these names? 
        Are they the same thing? What are the differences. All the terms are slightly differnt. Coronavirus is a general name
        for a family (or group) of viruses. There are many coronaviruses around one of the new (novel) coronavirus that the 
        The <a href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> (basically the group of people that officially names viruses) called SARS-Cov-2.
        See <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z">Nature paper</a>.
        
        The video below is from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFq5vPnNRNNNysLrktz4aSw>Strong Medicine</a. 
        It provides an in-depth explanation about how viruses get their names. It was filmed just before the new coronavirus was given its 
        name and so it still refers to it as "the novel coronavirus".<br />

         <h2>Epidemic vs Pandemic</h2>
         We are now constantly hearing about epidemics and pandemics and all these new words can be confusing! Luckily, 
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nKWrOxInft2dNfgSFFvsA">Grammer Girl</a> is here to the rescue by 
         explaining what the difference is.
